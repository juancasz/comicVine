This is a comicbook directory built using React and the comicvine API(https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/)  
Before starting the application you must activate this cors-proxy (click on Request temporary access to the demo server): http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo  
This a temporary solution while I implement my own cors-proxy    
You can use the application here: https://comicdirectory.herokuapp.com/
